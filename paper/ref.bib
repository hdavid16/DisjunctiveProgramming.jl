Usually, this task has been performed through equation based models. This approach presents several problems, as tedious and complicated component properties estimation or the handling of huge problems (with thousands of equations and variables). We propose a GDP approach as an alternative to the MINLP models coupled with a flowsheet program. The novelty of this approach relies on using a commercial modular process simulator where the superstructure is drawn directly on the graphical use interface of the simulator. This methodology takes advantage of modular process simulators (specially tailored numerical methods, reliability, and robustness) and the flexibility of the GDP formulation for the modeling and solution. The optimization tool proposed is successfully applied to the synthesis of a methanol plant where different alternatives are available for the streams, equipment and process conditions.}

To achieve this goal, we propose an optimization model that minimizes the total cost using Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP). Specifically, the model determines both investment decisions (number, size, location, and time of generators to install, retire, and decommission) and operation decisions (number of operating/backup generators, operating capacity, and expected power output) by imposing penalties when the demand is not satisfied, and a system has low reliability. The model is verified through an illustrative example of two regions with four power stations over five operating periods.}

This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic programming GDP (Generalized Disjunctive Programming) model with reliability constraints to deal with both the exogenous and endogenous uncertainties in process synthesis, where the reliability model is incorporated into the flowsheet superstructure optimization. The proposed stochastic programming model anticipates the market uncertainties through scenarios for selecting the optimal flowsheet topology, equipment sizes and operating conditions, while considering the impact of selecting parallel units for improving plant availability. An improved logic-based outer approximation algorithm is applied to solve the resulting hybrid GDP model, which effectively avoids numerical difficulties with zero flows and provides high quality design solutions. The applicability of the proposed modeling framework and the efficiency of solution strategy are illustrated with two well-known conceptual design case studies: methanol synthesis process and toluene hydrodealkylation process. The model, which integrates reliability (endogenous uncertainty) and exogenous uncertainty, shows the best economic performance with the increasing operational flexibility and plant availability.}

abstract = {The synthesis and optimization of multilevel refrigeration systems is challenging because it’s a highly non-linear, multi-variable, and multi-modal problem. This work presents a novel approach to develop a complete generalized disjunctive programming model for the synthesis and optimization of multilevel refrigeration systems. The model is based on the application of mass, energy, and thermodynamic model equations and developed to optimize the total shaft work requirement of the system. The presented model is very systematic, easily manageable, and can be extendable to include all design features for refrigeration systems. The model is solvable using advanced solution algorithms such as the Logic-based branch and bound because of it’s disjunctive nature. Thus the solution is sought in reduced space and avoids the full scale as is the case with Mixed integer linear/non-linear models. The model solution yields optimal temperature/pressure levels, mass flow rates, and the shaft work consumption. A case study of the precooling cycle of the propane pre-cooled mixed refrigerant (C3MR) LNG process is used to test the proposed model. The model results are validated by simulation using Aspen Hysys software. Shaft work savings of up to 12.3% are obtained from the model results against the base case. Preliminary estimations show that cost savings of up to 2.55 MM$/y are realizable against the base case.}

abstract = {Industrial water supply networks can use multiple water resources (i.e., municipal water, surface water, municipal treated wastewater, groundwater, and seawater) with their respective pre-treatment technologies to meet the industrial water demand. The water quality of each water resource varies, and the associated pre-treatment technologies provide different technical and economic efficiencies that directly impact the overall cost of the water supply network. This paper proposed a superstructure-based mathematical modeling optimization to design the multi-resources industrial water supply network with optimal pre-treatment technologies. The established model includes the relative equations among different pre-treatment units and water sinks, flow rate constraints, property constraints, logic constraints, and cost constraints. These constraints are used to describe water treatment technologies selection through general disjunctive programming (GDP) and transform them into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the problem solution. The minimum annualized cost of the water supply network is taken as an objective function. The optimization and comparison analysis of the coastal oil refinery water supply system is illustrated. The results show that an integrated water supply network of surface water and municipal treated wastewater has the lowest annualized cost of 12.3 million CNY/y. The cost is reduced by 7.44 million CNY/y compared to municipal water as the single water resource. This integrated water supply network saves freshwater resources, provides substantial economic gains, and encourages municipal treated wastewater reuse.}

ABSTRACT = {Models involving decision variables in both discrete and continuous domain spaces are prevalent in process design. Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) has emerged as a modeling framework to explicitly represent the relationship between algebraic descriptions and the logical structure of a design problem. However, fewer formulation examples exist for GDP compared to the traditional Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) modeling approach. In this paper, we propose the use of GDP as a modeling tool to organize model variants that arise due to characterization of different sections of an end-to-end process at different detail levels. We present an illustrative case study to demonstrate GDP usage for the generation of model variants catered to process synthesis integrated with purchasing and sales decisions in a techno-economic analysis. We also show how this GDP model can be used as part of a hierarchical decomposition scheme. These examples demonstrate how GDP can serve as a useful model abstraction layer for simplifying model development and upkeep, in addition to its traditional usage as a platform for advanced solution strategies.},

abstract = {Discrete-continuous optimization problems are commonly modeled in algebraic form as mixed-integer linear or nonlinear programming models. Since these models can be formulated in different ways, leading either to solvable or nonsolvable problems, there is a need for a systematic modeling framework that provides a fundamental understanding on the nature of these models. This work presents a modeling framework, generalized disjunctive programming (GDP), which represents problems in terms of Boolean and continuous variables, allowing the representation of constraints as algebraic equations, disjunctions and logic propositions. An overview is provided of major research results that have emerged in this area. Basic concepts are emphasized as well as the major classes of formulations that can be derived. These are illustrated with a number of examples in the area of process systems engineering. As will be shown, GDP provides a structured way for systematically deriving mixed-integer optimization models that exhibit strong continuous relaxations, which often translates into shorter computational times. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 59: 3276–3295, 2013},

Unlike the traditional Big-M reformulation that uses one M-parameter for each constraint, the new approach uses multiple M-parameters for each constraint. Each of these M-parameters is associated with each alternative in the disjunction to which the constraint belongs. In this way, the proposed MINLP reformulation is at least as tight as the traditional Big-M, and it does not require additional variables or constraints. We present the new Big-M, and analyze the strength in its continuous relaxation compared to that of the traditional Big-M. The new formulation is tested by solving several instances with an NLP-based branch and bound method. The results show that, in most cases, the new reformulation requires fewer nodes and less time to find the optimal solution.}

The proposed nonlinear relaxation is used to reformulate the GDP problem as a tight MINLP problem, and for deriving a branch and bound method. Properties of these methods are given, and the relation of this method with the logic based outer-approximation method is established.

abstract = {As mathematical computing becomes more democratized in high-level languages, high-performance symbolic-numeric systems are necessary for domain scientists and engineers to get the best performance out of their machine without deep knowledge of code optimization. Naturally, users need different term types either to have different algebraic properties for them, or to use efficient data structures. To this end, we developed Symbolics.jl, an extendable symbolic system which uses dynamic multiple dispatch to change behavior depending on the domain needs. In this work we detail an underlying abstract term interface which allows for speed without sacrificing generality. We show that by formalizing a generic API on actions independent of implementation, we can retroactively add optimized data structures to our system without changing the pre-existing term rewriters. We showcase how this can be used to optimize term construction and give a 113x acceleration on general symbolic transformations. Further, we show that such a generic API allows for complementary term-rewriting implementations. Exploiting this feature, we demonstrate the ability to swap between classical term-rewriting simplifiers and e-graph-based term-rewriting simplifiers. We illustrate how this symbolic system improves numerical computing tasks by showcasing an e-graph ruleset which minimizes the number of CPU cycles during expression evaluation, and demonstrate how it simplifies a real-world reaction-network simulation to halve the runtime. Additionally, we show a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation solver which is able to be automatically converted into symbolic expressions via multiple dispatch tracing, which is subsequently accelerated and parallelized to give a 157x simulation speedup. Together, this presents Symbolics.jl as a next-generation symbolic-numeric computing environment geared towards modeling and simulation.},

Computers and Chemical Engineering, 24, 2125–2141] have developed a reformulation of Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) problems that is based on determining the convex hull of each disjunction. Although the relaxation of the reformulated problem using this method will often produce a significantly tighter lower bound when compared with the traditional big-M reformulation, the limitation of this method is that the representation of the convex hull of every disjunction requires the introduction of new disaggregated variables and additional constraints that can greatly increase the size of the problem. In order to circumvent this issue, a cutting plane method that can be applied to linear GDP problems is proposed in this paper. The method relies on converting the GDP problem into an equivalent big-M reformulation that is successively strengthened by cuts generated from an LP or QP separation problem. The sequence of problems is repeatedly solved, either until the optimal integer solution is found, or else until there is no improvement within a specified tolerance, in which case one switches to a branch and bound method. The strip-packing, retrofit planning and zero-wait job-shop scheduling problems are presented as examples to illustrate the performance of the proposed cutting plane method.}
